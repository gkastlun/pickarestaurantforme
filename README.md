Silly tool to pick a restaurant from a list

Choosing a restaurant where to eat can be a painful task. This silly tool will
iterate over a list of restaurants where an item  is randomly selected 6 times
(<joke>like CBP chooses people randomly at airports</joke>). Then, the iteration
in which the randomly selected item is the same the 6 times, is the restaurant we
will eat, yay!. The outcome will alleviate the suffering of deciding each day.

## How to use it

Clone this repo and run the script as follows:

```
python restaurants.py
```
